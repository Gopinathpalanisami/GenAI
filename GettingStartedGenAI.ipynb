       "AIMessage(content=\"Generative AI, often abbreviated as Gen AI, refers to a category of artificial intelligence systems designed to generate content. This can include text, images, music, and other forms of media. Unlike traditional AI, which primarily focuses on recognizing patterns and making decisions based on existing data, generative AI models create new data that resembles the patterns and structures found in the training data.\\n\\nThe most well-known subsets of generative AI include:\\n\\n1. **Natural Language Processing Models**: These are designed to generate human-like text. Examples include OpenAI's GPT series, which can produce coherent and contextually relevant text based on input prompts.\\n\\n2. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: These involve two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, that work together to create realistic images. The generator creates new images, and the discriminator evaluates them, leading to improvements in the output.\\n\\n3. **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**: These are used for generating new images and data points by encoding input data into a latent space and then decoding it back.\\n\\n4. **Diffusion Models**: These models, used by systems like DALL-E and Stable Diffusion, generate images from textual descriptions, gradually transforming a random noise image into a coherent picture.\\n\\nGenerative AI has numerous applications, from content creation and design to simulation and modeling in various fields such as art, gaming, and scientific research.\", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 285, 'prompt_tokens': 12, 'total_tokens': 297, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_cbf1785567', 'id': 'chatcmpl-CJ7ELqoTW1bwiLNZa2tBTFoKkTSNQ', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run--e009fdfe-01f5-4844-938a-f74b83c9a17f-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 12, 'output_tokens': 285, 'total_tokens': 297, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})"
